## Intro
During the lockdowns of 2020, the frequency of messages in my Discord spiked and with it, the use of "bro", particularly "bro..."

It caught on like a bug.

I wanted to know who was the perpetrator of these "bro"s.

Thus this notebook was borne.

**This notebook generates a video of the usages of that word over time**

## Installation

3. `pip install -r requirements` (Makes use of Python Package bar_chart_race)
